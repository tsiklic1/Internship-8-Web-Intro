            Web development can be overwhelming, with frameworks and tools continually churning. <br>
            Here's some advice that has worked well for me on my own projects which emphasizes <br>
            simplicity, stability, and predictability. The recommendations I make here are only for tools <br>
            that are high quality and which are unlikely to change significantly in the future.
        </p>
        <p class = "indentedLink">
            Like most things I write on this blog, my intended audience is more or less "me if <br>
            I didn't know this stuff already", so if you're say a C++ developer who isn't super <br>
            familiar with nodejs etc and just wants to write a bit of TypeScript then this is the <br>
            post for you. People have a lot of strong opinions about this stuff — to my mind, <br>
            too strong, when a lot of the details really just don't matter that much, especially <br>
            given how whimsical web fashion is — but if you are such a person then this post <br>
            is certainly not for you!
        </p>
        <p>
            To start with, we're not going to use any preconfigured template repository. Blog posts like <br> 
            this one seem to usually start with "copy my setup" but that feels like the opposite of what I <br>
            want — I want the fewest moving parts possible and to be able understand what pieces I do <br>
            use are for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead we start from scratch:
        </p>
        <p class = "indentedCode">
            $ mkdir myproject <br>
            $ cd myproject
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, for frontend tooling, npm is inevitable. (Installing nodejs/npm is out of scope here <br>
            since it's OS-dependent but it's trivial.) Make your project a root directory for npm <br>
            dependencies, bypassing any questions:
        </p>
        <p class = "indentedCode">
            $ npm init -y
        </p>
        <p>
            This generates <span class ="codeLine">package.json</span>. Most of its contents aren't necessary, feel free to edit.
        </p>
        <p>
            With npm in place we install TypeScript. I think of TypeScript as the bare minimum for <br>
            keeping sane writing JS and it's a self-contained dependency. We install a copy of TypeScript <br>
            per project because we want the TypeScript compiler version pinned to the project, which <br>
            makes it resilient to bitrotting as new TypeScript versions come out.
        </p>
        <p class = "indentedCode">
            $ npm install typescript
        </p>
        <p>
            This downloads the compiler into the <span class = "codeLine">node_modules</span>  directory, updates <span class = "codeLine">package.json</span>, and <br>
            adds <span class = "codeLine">package-lock.json</span>, which records the pinned version of the compiler.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next we mark the repository as a TypeScript root.
        </p>
        <p class = "indentedCode">$ npx tsc --init</p>

            You might have some follow-up questions for recommendations which I will summarize in list form:
        </p>
        <ul class = "noLineSpaceList">
            <li class = "denseListElement"><span class = "boldText">Autoformatting.</span> prettier is standard but clunky and is set up similarly to how other <br>
                tools here have been set up. dprint is a newer replacement that I have liked more but <br>
                it's newer and riskier.
            </li>
            <li class = "denseListElement">
                <span class ="boldText">Linting.</span>  The current state of the ecosystem is a general mess, I suggest avoiding it.
            </li>
            <li calss = "denseListElement">
                <span class = "boldText">CSS languages.</span> Too complex for my taste, possibly also because my projects tend to <br>
                not be that visually complex.
            </li>
            <li class = "denseListElement">
                <span class ="boldText">Web frameworks.</span> This is a much more complex topic, worth an appendix!
            </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- priskoceno par paragrafa -->

        <p>
            That ends up enough for most things I do, hope it works for you!
        </p>
        <p class = "indentedCode">
            &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; <br>
            &lt;script src='main.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
            And call into preact from main.tsx:
        </p>
        <p class = "indentedCode">
            import * as preact from 'preact';
            <br><br>
            preact.render(&lt;h1&gt;hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;, document.body);
