        <p>
            A UNIX wizard hears cries of torment from his apprentice's computer room where the <br> 
            apprentice is studying, and goes to investigate.
        </p>
        <p>
            He finds the apprentice in obvious distress, nearly on the verge of tears. "What's the <br>
            problem?" he asks. "Why did you cry out?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "It's terrible using this system. I must use four editors each day to get my studies done, <br>
            because not one of them does everything."
        </p>
        <p>
            The wizard nods sagely, and asks, "And what would you propose that will solve this obvious <br>
            dilemma?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The student thinks carefully for several minutes, and his face then lights up in delight. <br>
            Excitedly, he says, "Well, it's obvious. I will write the best editor ever. It will do everything <br>
            that the existing four editors do, but do their jobs better, and faster. And because of my <br>
            new editor, the world will be a better place."
        </p>
        <p>
            The wizard quickly raises his hand and smacks the apprentice on the side of his head. The <br>
            wizard is old and frail, and the apprentice isn't physically hurt, but is shocked by what has <br>
            happened. He turns his head to face the wizard. "What have I done wrong?" he asks. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Fool!" says the wizard. "Do you think I want to learn yet another editor?"
        </p>
        <p>
            Immediately, the apprentice is enlightened.
