        You might be surprised, as I was, to learn that Chrome exposes an API to notify you when <br>
        the browser crashes on your page. It is part of a larger <a href="https://devdocs.io/dom/reporting_api">reporting API</a> that is designed to give <br>
        browsers a channel to inform you, the developer, of crashes and other things.
    </p>
    <p>
        In particular for a page crash you no longer have a page or JS context to receive the event,<br>
        so the API instead POSTs some JSON to a URL you provide. Per usual there were 
        <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/reporting-api-migration/">
            two slightly <br>
            incompatible versions of the API
        </a>
        , I imagine as they attempted to standardize. (I do not know <br>
        a lot about this space but it appears all of this is Chrome-only for now…)
    </p>
    <p>
        Figma, which is a large complex web app that often breaks browsers, uses these to monitor <br>
        for crashes. That is how I learned these systems existed — I was on call and an alert fired <br>
        about the crash rate.
    </p>
    <p>
        And here is where the second surprise appeared: the alert fired because the crash rate was <br>
        high, but a separate dashboard monitoring the crash rate appeared low. The discrepancy <br>
        turned out to be caused by a misconfiguration. We were segmenting the incoming crashes <br>
        by which portion of the site they affected, and the two systems slightly disagreed on what <br>
        they were watching.
    </p>
    <p>
        The crash rate in the core app, the browser-busting magic WASM WebGL piece that I was <br>
        attempting to monitor, had stayed level. The crash rate on a relatively static HTML <br>
        marketing page had risen! The marketing page, as I recall, had some of those swoopy CSS <br>
        animations on scroll that is common on today's marketing pages, and (edit: I had this wrong <br>
        in the first post, thanks Andrew!) an accidental change in ad targeting was bringing in a <br>
        bunch of users with lower-end mobile browsers that would crash.
    </p>
    <p>
        From this I took away an important lesson: even when your app is not pushing the <br>
        boundaries of browsers, monitoring for crashes is probably worth it. <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/articles/reporting-api/">Read this overview</a> to <br>
        get started; I believe it's as simple as providing a default endpoint in an HTTP header and <br>
        accepting POSTs there.
